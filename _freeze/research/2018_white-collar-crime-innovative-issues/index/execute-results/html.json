The time series includes data from 2000 to 2016. Furthermore, a seasonal ARIMA model is presented to model the data. Findings show that white-collar crime has increased more than 800 percent and crime rate more than 640 percent respectively, with a peak in 2015. Fraud and violation of trust contribute to over 91 percent of aggregated white-collar crime. A prediction for 2017 indicates a slight decrease of 5.7 percent compared to 2016.\n\n\n## Featured article figure\n\n\n\n::: {#fig-1 .cell .fig-cap-location-margin}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![The data show a clear non-linear series with no consistent trend.](featured.png){#fig-1 width=486}\n:::\n\nWhite collar crime Paraguay: 2000 - 2016\n:::\n\n\n",
