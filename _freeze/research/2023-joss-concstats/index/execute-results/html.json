In economics they give a first insight of a given market structure in a particular market. They are important to determine public policies and strategic corporate decisions. However, in research and in practice the most commonly used measure is the Herfindahl Hirschman Index (Herfindahl, 1950) (Hirschman, 1945), calculated as the sum of squared shares retained by individual firms in a given market.\n\n\n## Featured article figure\n\n\n::: {.cell .fig-cap-location-margin fig-hight='300'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Paired sample of large credit cooperatives.](featured.jpeg){#fig-1 width=243}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n",
