## Abstract


This research paper contributes to the literature of white-collar crime by using a unique data set of aggregated monthly white-collar crime incidents for Paraguay. The time series includes data from 2000 to 2016. Furthermore, a seasonal ARIMA model is presented to model the data. Findings show that white-collar crime has increased more than 800 percent and crime rate more than 640 percent respectively, with a peak in 2015. Fraud and violation of trust contribute to over 91 percent of aggregated white-collar crime. A prediction for 2017 indicates a slight decrease of 5.7 percent compared to 2016.
